# Explainable AI MAVE Hackathon 2024

Shared code space for XAI hackthon 2024 Mave meta-analysis group. We implement a toy imputer 
using MAVE scores and ESM embeddings while other participents tested various other baseline
imputation approaches (e.g. mean/medians, iterative imputer from sk-learn etc.) and generally
explored the dataset.

Using a dataset download from MaveDB with preliminary processing for the OT Perturbation Catalog.
